Laboratory work completed during the third semester.

# LAB 1
1. (8): expand the function arcsin(x) in a Taylor series, and also cover it with Unit Tests.
 
# LAB 2
1. (8): find the row number of the given matrix, which contains the longest series (sequence of identical elements).
2. (18): count the number of columns of the given matrix, which are composed of pairwise distinct numbers.
3. (28): determine whether a real matrix of size mxn is orthonormal, i.e. one in which the scalar product of each pair of distinct strings is 0, and the scalar product of each string with itself is 1. Print the appropriate message on the screen.

# LAB 3
1. (8): remove from the text all words of a given length that begin with a consonant.


# LAB 4
1. In a Java program, remove all comments.

# LAB 5
1. Several lines are entered from the file, in which the data is separated by spaces and commas. Among the data there are numbers (integer, positive, negative, etc.). display all numbers in a column (one number per line).

# LAB 6
1. Create a class "Book". This class has at least 2 fields: the string "title", the string "author". Override at least two methods of the Object class (toString [use the String method], equals [if the fields are the same]). Create a method for entering books. Main has two objects that we compare for equality.
2. Create a class set of books, in which to create a collection of books (ArrayList). Implement sorting methods (2 options: by title and by author) and binary search for books. To sort, define a natural order using the Comparable interface.
3. Sort by another attribute (not Comparable) and organize the search by another attribute. Use a comparator class that extends some interface.
4. Read from JSON file.

# LAB 7
1. Implement a GUI (in this particular case, Swing). Implemented a scheme by which you can determine the sign of the zodiac.
